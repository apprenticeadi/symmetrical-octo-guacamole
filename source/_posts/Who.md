This is a personal website belong to Zhenghao Li, an undergraduate physicist at Cavendish. This is the place where I dream, procrastinate, and try to impress potential employers. Click here for an [academic profile](www.apprenticeadi.com) of myself. 

This website is a product of months-long procrastination. I bought this domain name in July, when I was awed by a friend's [website](butteraddict.fun), where he posts notes, life and other random stuff. As a heavy addict to social media, I thought a personal website/blog might be my nicotine patch. 

Alas, procrastination still got the better of me for (almost) three months. With only less than 2 weeks to go until my daunting 4th year in Cambridge starts, fearing that I might not get as good a chance as now, I've finally found the mental strength to sit myself in front of my laptop (after watching a Liverpool-Arsenal game) and write some opening stuff for my website. 

First off, this website will see a mixture of Chinese, English, and (hopefully) some German. I'll do all the serious stuff in English, since I'll be putting this link in my CV; and do the rest in whatever tongue I'm using at that moment. (It's sometimes weird to be bilingual. I once had a dream in English but with Chinese subtitles.)

I'm a physicist, and a physicist with research interest in quantum information and quantum technology. I've spent much of the past 6 months reading all kinds of literature in this field, and there's no podcast/blogs/magazines explaining research advances at an undergraduate level, it's either popular science for the public, or serious science for the people in this field (or maybe these do exist but I just didn't search). I'd very much like to try writing some kind of blog like this. Let's see how long it takes before I get consumed by supervision work. 

I'm also a dreamer, an unrealistic one. Back in the days when I didn't own a smartphone, I'd dream about being a warrior, fighting romantically hopeless battles; a football star, carrying my national team to the world cup; a three times nobel prize winner, twice for physics and once for peace, and the list goes on. I'd like to re-live those days. I mean, I've always wanted to write a fantasy novel, but I keep disregarding my story ideas as childish. 

The English name for this website is Apprenticadi, a username I've been using a lot. The Chinese name means literally "Sisyphus walking downhill", because according to Albert Camus, despite knowing he'll have to repeat his fate again and again absurdly on his way downhill to fetch the boulder, "one must imagine Sisyphus happy". (I talk about Camus not because I understand him, but because it makes me feel stupidly intelligent.)

And it is in this happily absurd way that I open this website. I hope it can be something I'm proud of, when I look back in few years time to this chaotic and confusing 2020.
